# Tietokannat-ja-web-ohjelmointi-Projekti
A repository for the course project in [Tietokannat ja web-ohjelmointi](https://hy-tsoha.github.io/materiaali/) taken in the 4th period of academic year 2023-2024 at University of Helsinki by a student of Bachelor's Programme in Science.

The goal of the project is to create **an online application that supports billingual reading** in Python using a `Postgres` database. Billingual reading is a practice of reading the same book in 2 languages. The app would allow users to log in and upload pairs of machine-readable pdfs of the same book in two different languages. The website would process the pdfs, perform sentence tokenization using `spacy` or similar library, and then upload them to the server. The users would then be able to choose a pair of books that they uploaded and read them side by side. The goal is to make the UI user friendly, so that there is shortcuts for e.g. skipping the page or aligning the text of the two books and leaving bookmarks.

The assumption is that the uploaded books were purchased and used by users only for their own reading. Because of strict rules against intellectual theft, administrators need be able to delete books and users if they violate the Terms of Service or an intellectual right of authors.

Technical details: the project has many dependencies, including `Poetry`, `Python Flask`, `Pytest`, and the list will expland.  I'm using `Poetry` as my dependency manager. If it's recommended to just stick to using virtual environments instead, I can switch :sunflower:

The database would need to have at least the following tables:
```
-a table with users (username as email and password), possibly the same or a separate table with administrators 
-a table for uploaded pdfs that contains names, author, cover image, language, details and ids of books
-and a table that keeps track of settings and progress for individual users reading a particular pair of books. So for instance which sentence was being read from one book of the pair together with which sentence from the other, by whom, and how many sentences at a time.
-a table for named bookmarks, purely out of convenience for the reader
-a table for saved words. I also want to include a search box for translation using trans, a bash script that very quickly translates sentences and individual words that I have hotkeyed on my computer
```

Manual installation instructions (on the way is a single script that could handle installation):
Install postgresql if you haven't already. You can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/hy-tsoha/local-pg) or do the following at your university computer:
```
cd ~
touch .bashrc #possibly the file existed already
git clone https://github.com/hy-tsoha/local-pg.git
bash local-pg/pg-install.sh install .bashrc
```
To start postgresql database, run:
```
source .bashrc # or reload the terminal or log out and log in
start-pg.sh  
```
The database is necessary for the application to work, but once you're finished using the application, remember to close it with `Ctrl + c`. Now that your database is running, in a separate terminal run:
```
psql -h ~/pgsql/sock/ 
```
If your prompt has changed to `username=#`, that means that psql works correctly. You can exit it by pressing `Ctrl + d`.
Now let's download this repository. The location is actually important here, since if we install in a symlinked directory like Desktop, Downloads, or Documents, we won't be able to start a Python virtual environment later on. For me, installing in my /home/ad/lxhome/g/<username>/Linux directory works the best. So you can simply go over to: 
```
cd /home/ad/lxhome/g/<your_username>/Linux
git clone https://github.com/jakubgrad/Tietokannat-ja-web-ohjelmointi-Projekti.git
```
Now you want to populate the database with tables and some sample data:
```
psql -h ~/pgsql/sock/ < Tietokannat-ja-web-ohjelmointi-Projekti/schema.sql 
```
Go to the repository, install and enter the virtual environment:
```
cd Tietokannat-ja-web-ohjelmointi-Projekti/
python3 -m venv venv #It can take 20 seconds. Also, if you get Errno 95, you need to download the repository somewhere else and run this line inside it
source venv/bin/activate
```
Now your prompt should be preceeded with `(venv)` and you can install the dependencies for the application:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt      
```
Declare environment variables:
```
echo -e "DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://\nSECRET_KEY=a8cbee4648c1a65ba12c5b590852edab" > .env
```
